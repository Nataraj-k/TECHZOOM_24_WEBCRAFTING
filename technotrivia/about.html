        What are medical chatbots?
A medical chatbot or a healthcare chatbot is nothing but a conversational AI-powered solution specifically designed to make healthcare much more interactive and proactive. 

Medical chatbot are a blessing in disguise for the healthcare system since it minimizes the time spent by medical staff in collecting and processing patient information, disseminating healthcare-related information and guidelines, ensuring patient engagement, and more.

 Healthcare chatbots act as the vehicle or medium between patients and their healthcare providers and can be designated as the very first point of interaction with a clinic, hospital, or any other healthcare organization.

Although medical chatbot are technically not a recent innovation per se, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic that such chatbots rose to fame. At a time when hospitals were dealing with a heavy influx of both symptomatic and asymptomatic, frantic patients, medical chatbots quickly became the single most used tool for disseminating clear and precise information.

Chatbots were also used for firsthand symptom assessment. This ensured that those patients at immediate risk were given the care they needed while patients with milder symptoms were systematically monitored from their homes, reducing the load on healthcare systems in general.

But, this is just a single instance of how medical chatbots are transforming the healthcare industry. Apart from providing critical healthcare information, healthcare chatbots have benefitted the industry in a number of ways. Here’s a quick look at some of them.
